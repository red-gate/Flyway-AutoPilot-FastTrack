**Scenario**:
Youâ€™ve been asked to store promotional campaigns in a new table under the `Sales` schema.

**Objective**:
Create a `Sales.Promotions` table with the following columns:
- `PromotionID` (PK, INT)
- `Name` (NVARCHAR(50))
- `StartDate` (DATE)
- `EndDate` (DATE)
- `DiscountPercentage` (DECIMAL(4,2), must be between 0 and 100)

**Hints**:
- Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
- Add constraints for the primary key and discount percentage range.

Verify the table creation by checking the schema after running the migration.
