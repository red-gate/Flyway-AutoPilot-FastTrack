Flyway Autopilot allows you to trial an end-to-end database development and automated deployment process with very little setup.  With Flyway AutoPilot, you get: 

1. A SQL script to create ready-to-use sample databases, with the ability to test additional objects and scenarios
2. A pre-configured Flyway project to get started quickly
3. Integration with version control to track your changes and collaborate with your team
4. Example migration scripts that are already deployed to the sample databases and the ability to generate new migration scripts (both versioned and undo scripts)
5. A pipeline for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployments (CI/CD) to your sample databases
6. Reports to provide more visibility and safety checks integrated into the pipeline
